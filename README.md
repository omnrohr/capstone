# Casting Agency

Site live at : [afternoon-earth-48253.herokuapp.com](https://afternoon-earth-48253.herokuapp.com/)

This project is my capstone project for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree program.
It models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.
Authorized users can interact with the API to view,add,update,delete Movies and Actors details.

## API

In order to use the API users need to be authenticated. Jwt tokens can be generated by logging in with the provided credentials on the hosted site.

## Users to test with AUth0 locally

In order to test with JWT tokens use this:
- Send this request after deploy the code and run the server  [request](https://dev-uiw51rx8.us.auth0.com/authorize?audience=http://localhost:5000&response_type=token&client_id=WUm66lq1JkjNyGeSKyvozwGaii1te5VJ&redirect_uri=http://localhost:5000)
- It will redirect you the auth0 login page.
- Use these credentials to log in.
    Mananger
      username : `coffee_manager@coffe.com`
      password: `S6:MGmtQkRkW_YL`

    User
      username: `user@coffe.com`
      password: `S6:MGmtQkRkW_YL`
- Grap the token from response after redirect and past it in `MANAGER_TOKEN` and `USER_TOKEN` in the setup file and app test file.
- Now you can use CURL or run a test file.

## Project dependencies

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.9

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

To setup vurtual environment run the following command

```bash
pipenv shell
```

#### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

## Database Setup

The project uses Postgresql as its database, you would need to create one locally and reflect it in setup.sh.
To update the database and seed run the following :

```bash
python manage.py db upgrade
python manage.py seed
```

- you may need to change the database url in setup.sh after which you can run

```bash
source setup.sh
```

- Start server by running

```bash
flask run
```

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

- [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) - pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.

## Testing

Replace the jwt tokens in app_test.py with the ones generated on the website.

For testing locally, we need to reset database.
